# Classification-of-Germinated-Oil-Palm-Seeds-Based-on-Deep-Learning-Models
The aim of this project is to analyse and compare the performance and generalisability of a pre-trained classification model against a model integrating conventional image augmentation techniques and generative models for classifying the quality of germinated oil palm seeds based on their images.
